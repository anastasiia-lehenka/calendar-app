## **Calendar**

This is a simple meeting planning calendar for a meeting room in your office.

### **How to run the app**

Run **npm install** in your terminal.

Then run **npm run start** or **npm start** in your terminal and the starting page of the project will be available at: http://localhost:8000/calendar.html

Or you can access it on GitHub Pages using next link: https://anastasiia-lehenka.github.io/calendar-app/dist/calendar.html

###### Note

Note that first time you open the app your calendar will be empty as there are no events in the Local Storage yet. You need to manually create your first event using _New Event_ button on top of the page.

###### Task 1

Authorization is implemented using Session Storage. So to logout you need to close the tab with application in your browser or press _Logout_ button in the top right corner of the page.
